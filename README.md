A navigation and routing API that organizes screens into *user flows*, using the Flow Controller (Coordinator) pattern.

## Features

Use Flow Coordinators in order to:
- Reuse screens and flows across different parts of your app.
- Separate complex navigation logic from UI code.
- Handle deep linking and complex routing scenarios modularly.
- Guard screens from unauthorized access — for example, redirect to login if the user is not authenticated.
- Support nested navigators and flows.
- Support state restoration.
- Preserve compatibility with the Navigator API.
